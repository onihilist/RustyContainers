# RustyContainers

### Welcome to RustyContainer !

( üö®‚ö†Ô∏è **WARNING** : This lib is <ins>currently in development</ins>, **no warranty will be provided** )
- Not currently available in crates.io

**First of all, you're probably wondering, what is this library ?**

RustyContainer is a lib to create custom containers in Rust, running your entire project in a container, and managing everything to do with your containers/services. 
It's also made for **high-performance, scalability/flexibility and portability.**

**The functionalities of this lib at the end of development are as follows :**
- Create & Manage containers
- Perform CI/CD tests into each container
- Generating log for each container and tests

You can run your Rust project into a container but also run multiple other containers, here is an exemple : 

```rust
pub fn main() -> Result<(), std::io::Error> {
    RCServices {
        containers: vec![
            RCContainer::new()
                .set_name("first_service")
                .set_image("nginx:latest")
                .add_port("8080", "80"),
            RCContainer::new()
                .set_name("second_service")
                .set_image("rust:latest")
                .add_port("8080", "80")
                .add_port("777", "1010")
        ],
    }.generate_compose()?;

    Ok(())
}
```

This main function generates the following 'docker-compose.yml' file :

```docker-compose.yml
version: '3.8'
services:
  first_service:
    image: nginx:latest
    ports:
      - '8080:80'

  second_service:
    image: rust:latest
    ports:
      - '8080:80'
      - '777:1010'
```
